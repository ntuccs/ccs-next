An international conference, entitled “Navigating a Crossroads in the Semiconductor Alliance Coordinating Talent, Promoting Development and Avoiding a Race to the Bottom,” sponsored jointly by Rothermere American Institute at University of Oxford, Center for China Studies at NTU, Oxford China Policy Lab, Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission, and JH Whitney, was held during September 18-19, 2024, in the Hub, Kellogg College, University of Oxford, UK.

As the semiconductor industry and regulatory environment rapidly evolve, it is increasingly clear that coordinated international collaboration is essential. This conference convenes key stakeholders from the US, the UK, Taiwan, Japan, and the EU to address the importance of strengthening global semiconductor alliances, fostering talent development, and securing long-term economic growth. In addition, the vital role of track II diplomacy in these discussions cannot be overstated. Through this informal dialogue, This conference creates a unique space for frank, constructive conversations that often elude official channels. In terms of geopolitical complexity, this type of engagement is not just beneficial—it is quite necessary.

By doing so, this conference seeks to attain the goal of cultivating a setting where participants can communicate openly and candidly, adhering to the Chatham House Rule, which encourages the free flow of ideas and views while preserving privacy.
